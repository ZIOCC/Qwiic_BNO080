# Qwiic_BNO080

Note: As with all of the Version 1.0 Zio Qwiic boards, this board has been produced with the I2C pull-ups disconnected by default. If there's a significant length of wire between this board and your MCU, you'll need to solder closed the solder jumpers (labeled SDA, 3v3 and SCL) to connect the pull-up resistors to VCC.
